# Dev notes

Project was prepared for work in VSCode. Use Haxe Extension Pack.
Main build task targets web.

## Dependencies

- `luxeengine.com` - game engine with renderer and other stuff
- `fast-live-reload` - from NPM, get it globally.

## Haxe Cache servers

Project uses Haxe cache server to both compile the code and provide cod ecompletions while writing.

## Testpage

For some reason running testpage on Windows sucks balls. Run this in proper terminal instead:

```
fast-live-reload --interval 50 -s bin\web\ -sp 8090 src\ -e "flow build web --debug" assets\ -e "flow build web --debug"
```

After running task "Testpage" you'll get:

- testpage hosted at `localhost:8090`
- auto recompilation after you save the file
- testpage auto refresh after the compilation finishes

## Code formatting

Use astyle-extension for VSCode, you'll also need Astyle app on your device.
